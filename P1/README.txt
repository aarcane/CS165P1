got some ideas but no code from the following URL:

http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-largestor-smallest-elements-in-an-array/

run as make; make test; for default operation.

run as make; ./doalg n k r [...] where n = size of array, k = num elements to find, and r = number of runs.

./doalg is the same as ./doalg 10 3 1000 100 10 1000 1000 20 1000 10000 40 1000
